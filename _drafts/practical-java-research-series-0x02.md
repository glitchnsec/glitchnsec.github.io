Research Methodologies and Exploitation Considerations for Java-based targets
---

<h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>

This is the second blog of this series and we hope to explore getting started with researching Java Libraries. Topics covered include a brief note on Libraries, setting up a sample application that uses a library using Maven, Debugging of said application and Documentation or the lack thereof.

<h3>Libraries</h3>

A library in layman terms refers to a set of Java classes published by other developers. Library functionalities are exposed via APIs that other applications may use. The goal of a library is to be modular and reusable. Java does comes with its core set of libraries.

<h3>Using a Library</h3>

A library may provide sample applications or sources in its documentation that demonstrate the capabilities of the library. This is typically a decent starting point to understanding the library usage. For simplicity and clarity, this section demonstrates a setup whereby a researcher builds a custom application to demonstrate the usage of a library. Our Library of choice is the XStream Library
