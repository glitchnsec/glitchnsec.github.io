During my time as a B.Sc Computer Science student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, I was fortunate to have led the now defunct Computer and Network Security Division of the [Computer Science Enrichment Club](https://csec.club/) and served in the capacity of Teaching Assistant for the following Computer Science courses:

- [Operating Systems - CSCC69](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscc69h3)
- [Computer Networks - CSCD58](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscd58h3)
- [Computer and Network Security - CSCD27](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscd27h3)
- [Software Tools and Systems Programming - CSCB09](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscb09h3)
- [Introduction to Software Engineering - CSCC01](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscc01h3)
- [Introduction to Numerical Algorithms for Computational Mathemtics - CSCC37](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscc37h3)

I love teaching, and while I prefer In-person instructor-led, I'm working to develop my virtual and pre-recorded delivery formats.
