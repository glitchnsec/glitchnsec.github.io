Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet! On here, I intend to share some stuff I've come to learn, no matter how trivial and I aim to present material in a manner most suited for beginners in the cybersecurity space. This site is always a work in progress. If you would like to get in touch, you can find some social links in the site footnote! Thanks for stopping by and I hope you find something relevant. All the best!

# About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and budding professional, I enjoy sharing and obtaining knowledge of all sorts! I completed a B.Sc. Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto Scarborough in 2018.

During my time as a student, I was fortunate to have run the now defunct Computer and Network Security Division of the [Computer Science Enrichment Club](https://csec.club/) and served in the capacity of Teaching Assistant for the following Computer Science courses:

- Operating Systems - CSCC69
- Computer Networks - CSCD58
- Computer and Network Security - CSCD27
- Software Tools and Systems Programming - CSCB09
- Introduction to Software Engineering - CSCC01
- Introduction to Numerical Algorithms for Computational Mathemtics - CSCC37
    
I'm currently an N-Day Vulnerability Researcher on the Trend Micro Vulnerability Research Services Team.

As an N-Day Researcher, I perform root cause analysis for publicly disclosed software vulnerabilities. The goal is to implement a working proof of concept and ultimately determine and advise on generic exploit detection and mitigation strategies. My other areas of expertise within the cybersecurity space include: Software Engineering, Security Engineering, Malware Analysis, Digital Forensics, Threat Intelligence and Penetration Testing.

Some of my hobbies include, photography, making music and creating digital art. I may share some of that with you on here as well!
