# Hello !

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! On here, I intend to share some stuff I've come to learn, no matter how trivial and I aim to present material in a manner most suited for beginners in the cybersecurity space. This site is always a work in progress. If you would like to get in touch, you can find some social links in the site footnote! Thanks for stopping by and I hope you find something relevant. All the best!

# About Me

I'm a young professional and enthusiast in the CyberSecurity industry. Some of my areas of expertise and interest include: Security Research, Software Engineering, Security Engineering, Malware Analysis, Digital Forensics, Threat Intelligence and Penetration Testing. I also enjoy teaching, coaching, photography, making music and creating digital art.

Currently, I work as an N-Day Vulnerability Researcher on the Trend Micro Vulnerability Research Services Team. I perform root cause analysis for publicly disclosed software vulnerabilities. The goal is to implement a working proof of concept and ultimately determine and advise on generic exploit detection and mitigation strategies.

Previously, I worked as a Security Engineer on the TD Bank SecDev Team where I performed comprehensive effectiveness analysis of various Endpoint Detection and Response solutions. I contributed to developing an evaluation and reporting platform as well as implementing network attacks as testcases in accordance with the [Mitre Attack Matrix for Enterprise Endpoints](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/).

During my time as a B.Sc Computer Science student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, I was fortunate to have lead the now defunct Computer and Network Security Division of the [Computer Science Enrichment Club](https://csec.club/) and served in the capacity of Teaching Assistant for the following Computer Science courses: [Operating Systems - CSCC69](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscc69h3), [Computer Networks - CSCD58](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscd58h3), [Computer and Network Security - CSCD27](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscd27h3), [Software Tools and Systems Programming - CSCB09](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscb09h3), [Introduction to Software Engineering - CSCC01](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscc01h3) and [Introduction to Numerical Algorithms for Computational Mathemtics - CSCC37](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscc37h3). I love teaching, and I sincerely hope for more opportunities to hone my skills in the future!
